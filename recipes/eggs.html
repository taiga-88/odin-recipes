    <h2>About the Dish</h2>
    <p>Look no further for a method to make hard-cooked eggs. Fresh or old, they are easy to peel. This works for 1 to 12 eggs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 eggs, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a steamer insert into a pot and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to just below a boil. Add eggs to steamer insert and steam for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Immediately transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water until cool enough to handle. Make a small crack on the large end of each egg and place eggs back into the ice water for about 20 minutes. Peel.</li>
    </ol>
